  content: `Welcome to Coron, a slice of paradise in the Philippines! This guide will take you through some of the most breathtaking natural wonders this island has to offer. From therapeutic hot springs to crystal-clear lakes and vibrant marine life, here's your guide to experiencing Coron's natural beauty.

## Therapeutic Waters

### Maquinit Hot Spring
One of the few saltwater hot springs in the world, Maquinit offers a unique therapeutic experience. The water maintains a constant temperature of about 39-40Â°C (102-104Â°F), perfect for soothing tired muscles after a day of island hopping. The spring is surrounded by mangroves, creating a serene natural setting.

## Marine Wonders

### Siete Pecados Marine Park
A cluster of seven small limestone islands, Siete Pecados is a snorkeler's paradise. The area is teeming with diverse marine life, including colorful coral formations, tropical fish, and sometimes even sea turtles. The shallow waters make it perfect for beginners while still offering plenty to explore for experienced snorkelers.

### Twin Peaks Coral Garden
This underwater garden is a testament to the Philippines' rich marine biodiversity. The site features two coral-covered limestone peaks descending into crystal-clear waters. Snorkelers and divers can spot various species of fish, giant clams, and beautiful coral formations.

## Pristine Lakes

### Kayangan Lake
Often called the cleanest lake in Asia, Kayangan Lake is surrounded by towering limestone cliffs. The view deck offers one of the most photographed views in Coron. The lake itself is a mix of fresh and saltwater, creating a unique ecosystem. Don't miss the underwater rock formations visible through the crystal-clear water.

### Barracuda Lake
Named after a giant barracuda that once lived in its waters, this lake is famous for its thermocline - a dramatic temperature change between layers of water. Divers can experience warm surface water suddenly giving way to cooler depths. The limestone walls extending underwater create an otherworldly atmosphere.

## Beach Paradise

### CYC Beach
CYC (Coron Youth Club) Beach is one of the few public beaches in the area. This pristine stretch of white sand is perfect for swimming and sunbathing. The shallow waters and gentle waves make it ideal for families. The beach is surrounded by native trees providing natural shade.

## Travel Tips
