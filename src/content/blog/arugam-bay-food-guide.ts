      <h2>Quick Tip About Locator</h2>
      <p>By the way, I used Locator to save all these spots while I was exploring Arugam Bay. It's super handy when you're walking around and want to remember a place for later. Just save the location straight from Google Maps or any website, and it'll show up on your personal map. Makes it way easier to plan your meals and remember where all the good spots are!</p>
